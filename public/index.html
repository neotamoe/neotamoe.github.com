        <p class="description">Solo project created during a two week period during my time at Prime Digital Academy.  The quiz app is designed to complement a general education science course
          at Augsburg College (Sci123: Science of Food and Cooking).  This full stack web application includes a mongoDB with over 1000 quiz questions.  Questions are sorted by chapter
          as well as assigned up to 5 tags.  Students sign in to quiz themself on course content or submit a new question for inclusion in the database.  Questions can be
          selected by chapter or by tag/keyword.  Application administrator is notified by email when a student flags a question for review or submits a
          question for inclusion in the databse.  The administrator can edit, save or delete flagged or newly-submitted questions from the database.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a Licensed Independent Clinical Social Worker turned Software Developer with over a
          decade of experience in fast-paced medical settings.  My background as a social worker uniquely equips me
          with skills for working on teams with a wide variety of people and how to work on both a micro and macro
          level.  I am seeking a position that encourages and expects continued growth and development and will allow
          me to contribute to a team from day one.</p>
        <p>I utilize my combination of technical software developer skills and social work training to write clear code,
          solve problems, and create positive and effective working relationships with clients and team members.  Context-switching,
          multi-tasking, and managing change are integral to productivity and inherent in my day to day work.  I
          believe writing good code is only part of what makes a developer great and believe my ability to view situations
          from different perspectives complement my technical abilities and knowledge.  I am detail-oriented, hard-working, and hold
          myself to high standards and expectations.  I am a natural leader, team-builder and collaborator.</p>
        <p>I truly consider no job is too big and no task is too small; I know that often doing the things that arenâ€™t
          written in the job description are integral to getting things done and contributing to a team.  I believe asking
          questions is good, asking the right question is better and doing something with the answer is even better.</p>
        <p>I earned a Master of Social Work from University of Washington and a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology and Spanish from
          University of Minnesota, Morris.</p>
