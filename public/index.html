        <h3 class="description">Sci123 Quiz App - <span class="link"><a href="http://sci123.herokuapp.com">http://sci123.herokuapp.com</a></span></h3>
        <p class="description">Solo project created during a two week period during my time at Prime Digital Academy.  The quiz app is designed to complement a general education science course
          at Augsburg College (Sci123: Science of Food and Cooking).  This full stack web application includes a mongoDB with over 1000 quiz questions.  Questions are sorted by chapter
          as well as assigned up to 5 tags.  Students sign in to quiz themself on course content or submit a new question for inclusion in the quiz (verification done using Passport).  Questions can be
          selected by chapter or by tag/keyword.  Application administrator is notified by email when a student flags a question for review or submits a
          question for inclusion in the database.  The administrator can edit, save or delete flagged or newly-submitted questions from the database.</p>

        <h3>St Croix Valley Interactive Map - <span class="link"><a href="http://stcroixmap.herokuapp.com">http://stcroixmap.herokuapp.com</a></span></h3>
        <p>Interactive map with administrator view/privileges created for client (St Croix Valley Regional Tourism Alliance) for group project at Prime Digital Academy with
          three other students/contributors.  Application utilizes Google Maps API.  Map view features area attractions from four categories or suggested trips.  Trips show routes from user's current location.
          Admin view allows adding, editing and deleting of attractions or trips.  Admin authentication is done using Firebase.  Application was completed over a three week period.  I wrote a variety of code, but most
          involved front-end and client-side code including info window, multiple modals, custom map properties, custom map markers, navigation bar (responsive to screen size), and preparing site for deployment with environment variables.</p>

        <p>This full stack web application was made over a weekend about halfway through my time at Prime (week 5 of 7 in Tier 2).  Users search for movies and can select favorite movies to store on the favorites page.  This project was done
          before the OMDB API required a subscription.  The currently deployed version displays favorites, but no longer can search with OMDB API.  </p>

        <p>Web application made during in class time while learning and developing comfort with ng-view, services, controllers.  Users "high-five" a character and are randomly generated their "skill" and it is
          compared to the character's randomly generated "skill" level.  Each character has a different skill range.  Client-side logic compares the skill levels and calculates and displays points.</p>

        <p>This application was made in week 2 of Tier 2.  Calculations are made on server-side to practice server-side logic.  My emphasis was on functionality rather than styling.  </p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am a Licensed Independent Clinical Social Worker turned Software Developer with over a
          decade of experience in fast-paced medical settings.  My background as a social worker uniquely equips me
          with skills for working on teams with a wide variety of people and how to work on both a micro and macro
          level.  I am seeking a position that encourages and expects continued growth and development and will allow
          me to contribute to a team from day one.</p>
        <p>I utilize my combination of technical software developer skills and social work training to write clear code,
          solve problems, and create positive and effective working relationships with clients and team members.  Context-switching,
          multi-tasking, and managing change are integral to productivity and inherent in my day to day work.  I
          believe writing good code is only part of what makes a developer great and believe my ability to view situations
          from different perspectives complement my technical abilities and knowledge.  I am detail-oriented, hard-working, and hold
          myself to high standards and expectations.  I am a natural leader, team-builder and collaborator.</p>
        <p>I truly consider no job is too big and no task is too small; I know that often doing the things that arenâ€™t
          written in the job description are integral to getting things done and contributing to a team.  I believe asking
          questions is good, asking the right question is better and doing something with the answer is even better.</p>
        <p>I earned a Master of Social Work from University of Washington and a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology and Spanish from
          University of Minnesota, Morris.</p>
