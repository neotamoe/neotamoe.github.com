      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a Social Worker turned Software Developer with over a
        decade of experience in fast-paced medical settings.  My background as a social worker uniquely equips me
        with skills for working on teams with a wide variety of people and how to work on both a micro and macro
        level.  I am seeking a position that encourages and expects continued growth and development and will allow
        me to contribute to a team from day one.</p>
      <p>I utilize my combination of technical software developer skills and social work training to write clear code,
        solve problems, and create positive and effective working relationships with clients and team members.  Context-switching,
        multi-tasking, and managing change are integral to productivity and inherent in my day to day work.  I
        believe writing good code is only part of what makes a developer great and believe my ability to view situations
        from different perspectives complement my technical abilities and knowledge.  I am detail-oriented, hard-working, and hold
        myself to high standards and expectations.  I am a natural leader, team-builder and collaborator.</p>
      <p>I truly consider no job is too big and no task is too small; I know that often doing the things that arenâ€™t
        written in the job description are integral to getting things done and contributing to a team.  I believe asking
        questions is good, asking the right question is better and doing something with the answer is even better.</p>
      <p>I earned a Master of Social Work from University of Washington and a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology and Spanish from
        University of Minnesota, Morris.</p>
